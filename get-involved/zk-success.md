We _do not_ encourage tax evasion, promoting information leaks, speculating on tokens or token prices, or otherwise breaking the law.
2. **Be Kind and Respectful**: Treat everyone with kindness, empathy, and respect. We all come from different backgrounds, perspectives and experiences, so let's celebrate our differences and foster a culture of openness and understanding. We may have strong feelings about other layer 1 and layer 2 blockchains, but that is no reason to disparage, defame, or slander any competitor to ZKsync or what other chains are doing. Feel free to compare metrics and features, but keep to the facts and be respectful of all the builders in web3 trying to advance freedom through blockchain technology!
3. **Share and Learn**: Our community is a space for sharing knowledge, experiences, and ideas. Positively contribute to discussions, offer helpful feedback, be willing to educate others on your work and remain open to learning from others.
