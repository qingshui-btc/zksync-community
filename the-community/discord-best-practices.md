<summary>How to be helpful and provide guidance in the ZKsync Discord</summary>

1. Interact with kindness and a welcoming tone to make every user feel supported and valued in our community.
2. Treat every question with patience and understanding, acknowledging the diverse levels of experience within our community.
3. Only respond to questions if you're sure of the answer. If unsure, either research the topic, let someone else answer, or seek assistance from a ZK Success member if the question remains unanswered.
4. Contribute to a discussion only if you have additional relevant information or a different perspective, avoiding repetition of already provided answers.

<summary>How to handle spammers</summary>

If you see messages like "hh," "hu," "great," or "ok" that don't contribute to the conversation, those are likely spammers. With a community this large, some spam is unavoidable. Instead, keep contributing positively to the community.

For severe spamming incidents, report them and let the moderation team handle it. Focus on what really matters: building a great community.

<summary>Dealing with scammers</summary>

Reporting scams is important to keep Discord safe from fraudsters, hence why it is an essential role of ZK Success. Below are the steps on how to report a scam:

1. **Identify the scam:** the first part of reporting a scam is identifying it. Scams can take many forms, including phishing links, fraudulent Discord invite links, scammers requesting DM, or even impostors posing as support, team members or moderators.
2. **Report it:**
   1. Find and copy the Discord ID of the fraudster.
      * You can find it by ‚Äòright clicking‚Äô on their name and clicking on ‚ÄòCopy USER ID‚Äô.
   2. Post the User ID in the #report-scam channel and a give a short description of how they tried to scamm. Try to be clear and precise in your description.
      * Feel free to tag the moderators in your scam report so they can eliminate the scam as fast as possible.
   3. Add a direct link to the scam message if it has not been deleted already.
